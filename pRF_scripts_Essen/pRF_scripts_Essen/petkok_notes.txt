I changed the code a little bit, so that it can receive scanner triggers from the Bitsi.

In the ret.m script, you can set the trigger device. If you set the params.devices.UMCport to a positive number, it will try to use some (unknown to me) serial device. If set to -1, it will use the Bitsi. If set to -2, it will use the keyboard.

-1 seems desirable at the DCCN, -2 in Essen.

In the displayParams.m scripts, in the folder:
Kanizsa_PTB_scripts\pRF_scripts_Essen\MRstim\MRstim\trunk\Displays\Essen
I can set the screen number.

For Essen, set the stimulus size to 6 degree (radius).

How long should the stimulus period be?
(blanksLength x 4)+(number of steps x 8 x TR)

blanksLength = 10.5, will be rounded up to nearest multiple of TR. Currently, this is 4*3.408 = 13.632 s

number of steps = 12 (12 steps of 1 degree).

So, (blanksLength x 4)+(number of steps x 8 x TR) = 381.696 s (~ 6:20 mins).

(In the old script, it would have been (10.8*4) + (20*8*1.8) = 331.2)

prescan blank period should be 12s, so nearest multiple of TR = 4*3.406 = 13.632 s.
